# A Better Note

This mod is meant to redesign the Event "A Note for Yourself" into something more useful and fun for the player.

## Effects

The Event "A Note for Yourself" has new options allowing the player to store a copy of a card instead of losing a card. The player can also take the stored card without offering a replacement, leaving it empty for next time, or replace the stored card without adding it to their deck.

Additionally, the event has been made more consistent, so the player is more likely to see it show up during Act 2.

The event has also been upgraded to keep track of cards with miscellaneous values such as Ritual Dagger and Genetic Algorithm instead of resetting them.

## Design Goals

The normal event allows the player to store a card to be used in future runs. This concept, while cool, is ultimately not utilized to it's full potential. There are a few main issues causing this problem.

Primarily, the nature of the event is dual purposed. It allows the player to pick up a new card, and remove an old card. This creates a problem, however, where the player wants to remove a bad card from their deck, in order to make their deck better, but if they do, then every future time this event appears, there will be a bad card in the slot. Now, the player would have to either add a bad card to their deck, or ignore the event entirely, thus wasting an event space. This creates a cycle whereby the player either stops ever using the event, or has to waste a run by removing a good card from their deck, and taking a bad card. Neither of these options feel fun.

As a solution, "A Better Note" reimagines this event such that the player adds a copy of a card in their deck, thus allowing the player to avoid feeling like they are wasting their current run. Additionally, the player has the option of replacing the stored card without having to take the old card, in case they want to change the card without diluting their current deck. This allows the player to freely make use of this event without having to commit to it being useful at most every other run.

The normal event also runs into an issue where if it's encountered early in a run, the player will have no good cards to store, and if it's encountered late in a run, the player has no bad cards to remove. In order to make this event feel more useful and fun, "A Better Note" increases the odds of encountering the event during Act 2, which fits an enjoyable middle ground for being early enough that the player is still making deck design decisions, but late enough that the player has a general idea of what their deck is going to built towards. In keeping with the spirit of the game, the event is still random, and the player still might not see it every run, but it will feel far more satisfying to encounter, and will not feel so rare that it is useless to use.
